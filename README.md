# Fieldwork Flashcards

## About Fieldwork Flashcards

Ever since I can remember, my first love has been animals. As a kid I wanted to be like Jane Goodall or Steve Irwin. I followed this passion right through undergrad, and earned a degree in Wildlife & Conservation Biology. Throughout my time in this program, my professors and mentors emphasized the importance of local natural resources and native species. An expectation in every wildlife course; whether ornithology, herpetology, mammalogy, or entomology, was to memorize the clade and scientific name of every species, and to be able to identify that species in the field.

For this first SEIR project, I wanted to build something that I would've found useful and fun back in my college days. I thought back to the hours I spent making hundreds of flashcards...the papercuts, the hand cramps, the scissiors and glue. Though using these flashcards was essential to my education, I wouldn't call the memories of making them fond. My goal for this project is to make beautiful and user-friendly virtual flashcards that allow students like past me to take an active role in their learning, without all the steps that come before actually using the flashcards.

This is my first very rough idea of what I wanted this web app to look like, and what features I wanted to include. Dream big!

Here's a mockup I made in Gimp. This is the plan for the landing page, which I will try to replicate as closely as possible!
